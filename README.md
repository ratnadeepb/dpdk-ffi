# Working DPDK API (partial)

This work is basically slight modification of the code found [here](https://github.com/capsule-rs/capsule) (in the core dir). This work developed a nice interface for using DPDK in Rust and I have just exposed some internal and crate only function.

The main reason for doing so is to be able to program multi-process DPDK apps in Rust. As of now, there are no Rust libs/frameworks that do so reliably.

Capsule comes closest to providing this [support](https://github.com/capsule-rs/capsule/issues/74); however, it is still some distance off.
